# What Are Public AI Models?

Before we start using public AI models, let's understand what public models actually are.

## Pre-trained Models

The first point we need to understand is that **public models are pre-trained**.

What does this mean?

All AIs, before we can use them, need to go through a training stage where they learn to perform the specific task we want them to do.

### Training Process Examples

- **Text models**: Need to be trained to write text
- **Vision models**: Need to be trained to identify objects in images

### Training Requirements

The training stage is typically very intensive in terms of:

#### Processing Power
- Requires many GPUs
- Massive computational resources

#### Data Requirements
- Needs terabytes of data
- Extensive datasets for learning

### Why Use Pre-trained Models?

This means that only specific people and companies have the capacity for training. We, at home on our computers, or even in our companies, won't have access to:
- This quantity of data
- This amount of processing power

Therefore, we can use these pre-trained models so we don't have to go through this entire training process again.

## Open Models vs. Transparency

When we say models are pre-trained and have been openly released, we mean that **the weights are openly published and available for use**.

### How AI Models Work

Artificial intelligence has a neural network behind it. This neural network has:
- A series of parameters
- A series of weights (typically in the billions or hundreds of millions of parameters)

These weights are what perform the calculations to:
- Transform your input into output
- Make predictions
- Generate text, images, or other content

### What "Open" Means

When we say a model is open, it means these weights were released after training. Companies like:
- Google
- Meta
- OpenAI

They trained the artificial intelligence, received these trained weights, and released them openly, saying "Here it is, you can use it freely."

## Important Considerations

### Open ≠ Transparent

However, just because models are open doesn't mean they are transparent. We need to consider several points:

#### 1. Methodology
- **Not always explicitly disclosed**: You don't know what process was used to train the model

#### 2. Code Availability
- **Not necessarily available**: You can't necessarily access and analyze the code to see how it works

#### 3. Training Data
- **Not necessarily disclosed**: You don't know if the AI was trained on copyrighted data
- **Ethical concerns**: Data might have been "stolen" from artists, raising many ethical questions

### Licensing and Terms of Use

The license and terms of use for these models can vary significantly.

#### Open Models vs. Open Source Models

**Open Source Models**:
- Follow a philosophy of being free
- You can use them
- You can modify them
- You can distribute them openly

**Open Models**:
- Don't necessarily follow this model
- May have restrictions on commercial use
- May have restrictions on modification and distribution
- You might not be able to use them in your company because you'd be violating the terms of use

## Key Takeaways

These are important points to consider:
- **Transparency aspects**: Understanding what you don't know about the model
- **Terms of use**: Legal and commercial implications

Despite these considerations, **public models are still very good for**:
- Learning how models work
- Testing and experimentation
- Running on your own machine
- Getting started without training from scratch

The main advantage is that they're already available pre-trained – you just need to download and use them.
